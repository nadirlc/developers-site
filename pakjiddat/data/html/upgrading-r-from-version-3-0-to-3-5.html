<p>R is a free software package for statistical computing. It is part of most Linux distributions. However the latest version of R is not always available. To install the latest version of R we need to add the url of a CRAN mirror to a file in <b>/etc/apt/sources.list.d</b>.</p>

<p>CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers that provide upto date information on R such as documentation, source code and news about R development. To install R, we need to issue the commands: <b>apt-get update</b> followed by <b>apt-get install r-base r-base-dev</b>.</p>

<p>To update R to a newer version we need to replace the CRAN url in <b>/etc/apt/sources.list.d</b>, with a url that points to the newer version of R. After that we need to issue the commands: <b>apt-get update</b> followed by <b>apt-get upgrade</b>. Since the new CRAN url requires different package signing keys, we will get an error similar to:</p>

<p><b>"following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY"</b></p>

<p>The solution is to import the package signing keys for the new R package using the command: <b>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys [ley_name]</b>, where key_name is the short signature of the missing key as indicated in the error message. After that the <b>apt-get upgrade</b> command should work without problems</p>
