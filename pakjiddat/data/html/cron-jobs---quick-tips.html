<p>Following are some quick tips related to Cron Jobs:</p>

<p>
A cron tab entry has 5 fields. These are: <b>minute, hour, day of month, month and day of week</b>. For example:</p>
<pre><b>
*/30 * * * 1,3
</b></pre>
<p>The above entry will run every 30 minutes on Mondays and Wednesdays</p>

<p>To run a Cron Job at random intervals we need to prefix the Cron Job command with the <b>sleep</b> bash command. For example to run a Cron Job every 5 to 7 hours at random intervals, we can use the following:</p>
<pre><b>
0 */5 * * * sleep $[RANDOM\%120]m; path-to-script
</b></pre>
<p>In the above code, the '%' has to be escaped. The code: <b>$[RANDOM\%120]</b> generates a random number between 0 and 120. This is the number of minutes that script will pause</p>
<p>The script will run at the times: 05:00+(rand(0, 120)), 10:00+(rand(0, 120)), 15:00+(rand(0, 120)), 20:00+(rand(0, 120)) and 00:00+(rand(0, 120))</p>
