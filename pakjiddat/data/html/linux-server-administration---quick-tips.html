<a href='http://askubuntu.com/questions/257425/can-i-force-grub2-update-not-to-use-uui'><h6>Force grub2 to not use UUID</h6></a>
<p>When restoring backup of virtual machine, the backup process may create a new disk with a new UUID. In such cases it may be useful to update grub2 so it uses the disk physical path instead of the disk UUID</p>
<p>The server may not reboot if the UUID of the new disk is different from the UUID of the old disk. One possible solution is to ensure that /etc/fstab file uses physical paths instead of UUID. Another solution is to update grub configuration so it uses physical device paths e.g /dev/xvda1 instead of UUID of disk</p>

git clone -b php7 https://github.com/php-memcached-dev/php-memcached.git
phpize
./configure
make
make install

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace'><h6>Debugging programs on Linux using strace</h6></a>
<p>Strace is a system tool that is used to debug programs on Linux based operating systems. It uses a feature of the Linux kernel known as ptrace.</p>
<p>Strace as its name suggests is used to trace operating system calls. It can be used to find out if a program is getting stuck because of a missing file or because of shared memory problems. For example it can show the id of the semaphore that is causing the program to fail. This semaphore can then be removed using the ipcrm command. The ipcrm command allows removing System V inter-process communication (IPC) objects and associated data structures from the system</p>

<a href='https://serverfault.com/questions/295565/pscp-upload-an-entire-folder-windows-to-linux'><h6>Using PSCP command for copying files and directories</h6></a>
<p>PSCP is a command that allows uploading files and folders to a remote server. Its benefit is that it does not require rsync to be installed on the remote server. The PSCP command can be used for copying data to a shared hosting platform which does not support rsync and does not provide shell access. It can also be used to transfer data between Windows and Linux servers.</p>
<p>The following command can be used to recursively copy a folder to a remote destination:</p>
<pre><b>pscp -r {source_folder} {user_name}@{remote_server}:{remote_folder_path}</b></pre>

<a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38021/how-do-i-find-the-authoritative-name-server-for-a-domain-name'><h6>Finding name server records for domains using Dig</h6></a>
<p><b>Dig</b> is a useful command line tool which allows retrieving DNS records for a domain.</p>

<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server'>Authoritative name servers</a> are servers that provide DNS information about a domain. An Authoritative name server may be a primary or secondary name server. A primary name server contains definitive and reliable information about a domain. A secondary name server is a slave name server which contains replica of dns records on a primary name server</p>
<p>To fetch the list of name server records for a domain we can use the command: <b>dig NS {domain_name}</b>. If we add the +short flag, then a summary of the information is returned. Other types of DNS records may be fetched similarly</p>
