<p>Some times we need to non-interactively run scripts which commit to git source code repositories that are hosted remotely. For example we may want push changes to a git repository stored on Bit Bucket. Normally we will be asked to enter our Bit Bucket credentials, but this can be automated. There are two ways of doing this:</p>

<p>We can use credential caching. This will cache our credentials for a given duration. For example use the following command to cache your git credentials for 1 hour:</p>

<pre>
<b>git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 3600'</b>
</pre>

<p>Another option is to place a .netrc file in your home directory. This file is used by curl which is used by git when working with remote repositories. The format of this file is as follows:

<pre><b>
machine bitbucket.org
login your-bitbucket-username
password your-bitbucket-password
</b></pre>

<p>The above methods should work with any remote git hosting.
