<p>HTTP2 requires encryption over SSL. The recommended SSL protocol for HTTP2 is TLS 1.2. Ciphers are encryption algorithms used by SSL protocols.</p>

<p>Certain devices specially old ones such as old Android mobile phones or old operating systems like Windows XP, support outdated SSL Ciphers that are not supported by HTTP2 protocol.</p>

<p>The <a href='https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#BadCipherSuites'>TLS 1.2 Cipher Suite Black List</a> shows the list of all SSL Ciphers that are not supported by the HTTP2 protocol. If a web browser running on an old operating system requests a SSL Cipher that is on the list of unsupported Ciphers, then the HTTP2 implementation of the browser should reject the connection to the server with <a href='https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#INADEQUATE_SECURITY'>INADEQUATE_SECURITY</a> error message</p>

<p>To test if the connection between your device and a web server is over a reliable and secure HTTP2 connection, go to <a href='https://www.ssllabs.com/index.html'>https://www.ssllabs.com/index.html</a> and enter the url of the website</p>
