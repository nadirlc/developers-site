<p>Both installation options require Java Runtime Environment version 8 and the JDBC driver for the selected Database management system. Installation from WAR file also requires Apache Tomcat server. Both installation options can be completed in a few steps as described in the installation guide</p>

<p>After the Communote has been downloaded and installed, it can accessed from the browser at http://localhost:8080. The startup page shows a web based wizard that allows the Communote to be configured</p>
