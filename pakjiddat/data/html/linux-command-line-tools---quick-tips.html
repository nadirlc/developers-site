<a href='https://linux-tips.com/t/using-custom-port-for-rsync-over-ssh/467/2'><h6>Using Rsync over custom SSH port</h6></a>
<p>Rsync can be used with custom SSH ports. For example to copy data from a remote server that is running SSH server over port 3000, the following command can be used:</p>

<p>For example the following rsync command uploads the contents of the current folder to a remote server and sets the owner and group of the uploaded data to www-data:</p>
<pre>
<b>
rsync -avz * {remote_user}@{remote_server}/{remote_server_path} --chown=www-data:www-data
</b>

<a href='https://askubuntu.com/a/643410/547282'><h6>Adding text to all files with BASH</h6></a>
<p>We often have a need to rename all files at once. For example we may need to add a certain text to all files within a folder. We can do this using a programming language. However the Bash programming language allows us to do this very easily using the <b>rename</b> command.</p>

<p>For example to add the text "_test" before the file extension to all mp3 files in a directory, we can use the following command:</p>

<pre><b>
rename -n 's/(.*)\.mp3/$1_test.mp3/' *.mp3.
</b></pre>

<p>This was suggested in an answer to the question <a href='https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/370313/add-text-to-end-of-the-filename-but-before-extension/511382#511382'>Add text to end of the filename but before extension</a> on StackOverflow.</p>
