<p><a href='https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html'>Apache Mod Status</a> is an Apache module that provides useful information about the requests being sent to Apache.</p>

<p>It provides information such as the PID of Apache processes, the number of active and idle threads in each process, the thread id and request handled for each thread</p>

<p>Apache mod_status is available by default in most Apache servers installations. To enable mod_status, we need to enable the mod_status Apache module. We then need to enable the mod_status handle within a location directive. This directive can be placed within a virtual host block. For example:</p>

<pre>
<b>&lt;Location /server-status&gt;
SetHandler server-status

Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
Allow from .example.com
&lt;/Location&gt;
</b></pre>

<p>This will allow the Apache status information to be accessed on the url: <b>http://localhost/server-status</b>. If we add refresh=N to the url, then the status page will refresh every N seconds. For example: <b>http://localhost/server-status?refresh=5</b>. The <b>ExtendedStatus</b> Apache directive allows extra information to be displayed with mod_status. This directive is used side wide and cannot be applied on a virtual host basis. It can slow down the server, so it should only be used if needed</p>
