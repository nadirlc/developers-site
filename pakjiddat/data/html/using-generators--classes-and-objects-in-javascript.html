<h4><u>JavaScript Objects</u></h4>
All values in JavaScript are objects except for primitive values which have no methods and properties.

<p>JavaScript defines 5 primitive data types, which are: <b>string, boolean, null, undefined and number.</b></p>

<p>A JavaScript object is a collection of named values which are called properties. An object property can be a primitive, function or an object.</p>

<p>An object method is an object property containing a function definition.</p>

<p>Examples of creating JavaScript objects: </p>

<pre><b>
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
</b></pre>

<pre><b>
var person = new Object();
</b></pre>

<pre><b>
/** The Object.create creates an object from an existing object */
const me = Object.create(person);
</b></pre>

<p>JavaScript objects are said to be mutable or changeable. When an object is assigned to another object, the assignment is done by reference. A new object is not created.</p>

<p>All JavaScript objects are descendants of the built in <b>Object</b>. All objects inherit properties that are in <b><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype'>Object.prototype</a></b>. These properties may be overridden by the objects. For example <b>toString()</b> method.</p>

<h4><u>JavaScript classes</u></h4>
<p><b>ES6</b> introduced a new keyword <b>class</b>, which allows creating classes using syntax that is common to most programming languages. The <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes'>class syntax</a> also allows inheritance. The class syntax is just a wrapper for <b>object.prototype</b>. It is implemented using the built in <b>object.prototype</b> property.</p>

<p>A major different between function declarations and class declarations is that functions are hoisted while classes are not. When we say that function declarations are hoisted, it means that a function can be called before it is defined, while a class cannot be used before it is defined. Following example shows how to declare and use a JavaScript class:</p>

<pre><b>
class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
    this.area = (width *height);
  }
  get area() {
    return this.calcArea();
  }
  set area(new_area) {
    this.area=new_area;
  }
}
const p = new Rectangle(10, 4);
let area = p.area;
p.area   = 20;
</b></pre>

<p>The <b>constructor</b> keyword defines a function that is automatically called when an object is instantiated.</p>

<p>The <b>get</b> and <b>set</b> keywords allows functions to be called when a property is read or updated.</p>

<p>Functions prefixed with <b>static</b> keyword are called on the class. They cannot be called on an instance of the class</p>

<p>The <b>extends</b> keyword allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The <b>super</b> function should be the first line of code in the class constructor. It calls the parent class constructor</p>

<h4><u>Using Generators in JavaScript</u></h4>
<p>Generators were introduced in ES6. One of the benefits of Generators is that they allow efficient handling of large arrays. JavaScript implements generators using the <b>yield</b> keyword and <b>function*</b> function declaration.</p>

<p>The <b>function*</b> denotes a generator function. Within the function, the yield keyword can be used. The following code describes how to use generators in JavaScript:</p>

<pre><b>
function* collection_name()
{
    yield 1;
    yield 3;
    yield 5;
    yield 7;
}

for(let count of collection_name())
{
    console.log(count);
}
</b></pre>
