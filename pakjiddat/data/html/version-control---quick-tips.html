<p>If we have a git repository with large files, and we need to push changes to a remote repository, then we might get the following error:</p>

<pre>

<p>To correct this error we need to increase the size of the git configuration variable http.postBuffer. We can do this with the command: <b>git config --global http.postBuffer 157286400</b></p>

<a href='https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging'><h6>Updating last commit without changing annotated tags</h6></a>
<p>If you need to make modifications to the last commit of a Git Repository, without making changes to the annotated tags, then the following script may be used. The script also updates the remote repository</p>

<pre><b>
# add changes to staging area
git add .
# changes in the staging area are added to the last commit. last commit message can also be changed
git commit --amend
# the annotated tag called "v1.0.0" is deleted. this should be the most recent annotated tag
git tag -d v1.0.0
# the most recent annotated tag is deleted from the remote server
git push origin --delete v1.0.0
# a new annotated tag is added, pointing to the last commit
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "initial commit"
# the last commit is pushed to the remote repository
git push origin master -f
# all annotated tags are pushed to the remote repository
git push --tags
