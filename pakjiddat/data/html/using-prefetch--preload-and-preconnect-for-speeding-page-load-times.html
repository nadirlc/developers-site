Prefetch, Preload and Preconnect are mechanisms supported by modern web browsers that allow efficient loading of web resources.</p>

<p><b>Preload</b> allows controlling how resources such as images, CSS and JavaScript files are loaded on the current page. For each resource that we want to preload, we have to use a link tag with rel="preload" attribute. The following examples show how to preload resources:</p>

<pre><b>
&lt;!-- allows preloading an image --&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; href=&quot;image.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;!-- allows preloading a font file --&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; href=&quot;https://example.com/fonts/font.woff&quot; as=&quot;font&quot; crossorigin&gt;
&lt;!-- allows preloading css --&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.keycdn.com/blog/css/mystyles.css&quot; as=&quot;style&quot;&gt;
</b></pre>

<p>The main benefit of the preload directive is that it allows important resources to be loaded earlier. For example if there is a stylesheet or image that is required for a page to display properly, then it can be preloaded by adding the relevant link tags in the head section of the document</p>

<p><b>Prefetch</b> is similar to preload but allows efficient loading of resources that are likely to be accessed by the user, such as a next or previous link. A drawback of prefetch is that it can cause certain page metrics such as ad statistics, visitor count etc to be miscalculated. For example <a href='https://www.scl.com/insights/blog/google-chrome-prefetchprerender-inflating-web-analytics-stats/'>Google Chrome has been known to miscalculate web analytics stats</a>. There are three types of prefetch directives:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>link-prefetch</b>. It allows a link to be fetched in advance before it has been clicked by the user. The contents of the link are saved to the browser cache</li>
<li><b>dns-prefetch</b>. It allows the host name of the resource to be resolved in advance. It eliminates the dns resolution step when the resource is requested by the user</li>
<li><b>pre-render</b>. It allows a resource to be fetched and processed before being requested by the user. For example a link marked with the directive <b>rel="prerender"</b> will be fetched and processed by the browser. It should be used with caution as it can consume resources on mobile devices</li>
</ol>

<p><b>preconnect</b>. The preconnect directive allows establishing tcp connections for a resource before it is actually requested. For example tls negotiations, tcp handshake and dns resolutions.</p>
