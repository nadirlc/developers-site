<p>The RAM on a server can be monitored using <b>/proc/meminfo</b> and awk commands. <b>/proc/</b> is a special file system created by the Linux kernel which contains kernel related information such as CPU and memory usage. <b>/proc/meminfo</b> contains information about memory usage.</p>

<p>The following bash script can be used to extract memory usage information from <b>/proc/meminfo</b>. It uses the <b>awk</b> text processing command for parsing memory information. It uses <b>bc</b> command for performing floating point operations. The bash scripting language does not support arithmetic operations on floating point numbers so an external tool like <b>bc</b> is needed</p>

<pre><b>
# the total memory. the MemTotal row is extracted using awk. the second column of this row is then extracted and saved to total variable
total=$( awk '/MemTotal/ {print $2}' &lt; /proc/meminfo )
# the available memory. the MemAvailable row is extracted using awk. the second column of this row is then extracted and saved to available variable
available=$( awk '/MemAvailable/ {print $2}' &lt; /proc/meminfo )
# the formula for calculating percentage of available memory is piped to bc command. the output of bc command is saved to memory_available variable
memory_available=$(echo "($available*100/$total)" | bc)
# if the available memory is less than 30%
if [ "$memory_available" -lt "30" ];
then
    # the body of the alert email is saved to a temprary file
    echo "Hello Admin. The Memory usage on server is $memory_available%. Please check!" > /tmp/mail_body.txt
    # the mailx command is used to sent the email. it sends the email using gmail server.
    # this is useful on servers that have limited access to email servers such as Google Compute instance
    mailx -s "Memory usage on server is more than 70%. Please check!." -r "reply_email" -S smtp="smtp.gmail.com:587" -S    \<br/>smtp-use-starttls -S smtp-auth=login -S smtp-auth-user="gmail_address" -S smtp-auth-password="gmail_password" -S \<br/>ssl-verify=ignore recepiant_email &lt; /tmp/mail_body.txt
