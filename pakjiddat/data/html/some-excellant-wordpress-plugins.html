<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This blog post is about my experience with using WordPress plugins. WordPress is an excellent blogging platform that is used by millions. It has an enormous number of plugins that are maintained by people all over the world. You can find a WordPress plugin for just about any function you can imagine. WordPress has evolved from a blogging platform to an application platform, content management system and more. Plugins such as <a title="Buddypress" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/">Buddypress</a> can transform your WordPress into a full featured online social community or even company intranet.</p>

<h3>WordPress Plugins</h3>

<p>I found the following WordPress plugins useful:</p>

<div>
<ul>
	<li>
<a title="Wordfence Security" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence"><h4>Wordfence Security</h4></a>

<p>This is an excellent plugin that keeps your WordPress secure. With increase in popularity, WordPress has become the target of hackers and bots. There are several viruses that target WordPress core and WordPress plugins.</p>

<p>Wordfence scans your WordPress files and emails you if it finds a suspicious file. WordFence compares the WordPress files with the ones from wordpress.org. If it sees a changed file, it sends a notification email. It also emails you when someone logs in to your WordPress site.</p>

<p>Wordfence also sends newsletters to its users by email. These contain important security related information for WordPress such as new WordPress viruses. One of their newsletters that I found interesting is titled <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2014/11/wordpress-security-nulled-scripts-cryptophp-infection/">"WordPress Security: Nulled Scripts and the CryptoPHP Infection"</a>. I recently had to recover a hacked WordPress website and found <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/docs/how-to-clean-a-hacked-wordpress-site-using-wordfence/">"How to Clean a Hacked WordPress Site using Wordfence"</a>, from Wordfence very useful.</li>

	<li>

<p>This plugin collects and displays statistics about your blog posts, such as the number of visitors, duration of visits, number of page views etc. There are other analytic plugins for WordPress but I found this one quite useful since it integrates well with WordPress. It provides a nice dashboard from where you can view detailed statistics about your website visitors. One drawback of this plugin is that it can slow down your website.</li>

<p>This plugin replaces the next/previous links on your blog with automatic scrolling. When the user reaches the end of the page, the next set of blog posts are automatically displayed. The user can view all your blog posts on one page.</p></li>

<a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/"><h4>NextScripts: Social Networks Auto-Poster</h4></a>
