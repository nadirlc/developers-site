<p>Output buffering in Php allows output from a Php script to be stored in a buffer. When the buffer is flushed, the output is displayed to the user. Sometimes we may want to disable output buffering, so we can quickly access the output from a Php script. For example it is useful to be able to view the output from long running scripts.</p>

<p>The output from a Php script can be buffered by other tools such as the web server, intermediate proxy servers, web server modules, web browser, Php Interpreter etc.</p>

<p>Disabling Php output buffering is simple when using mod_php. We only need to disable the output buffering in the php.ini configuration, but when using Php in a CGI or FastCGI environment it can be a bit tricky. Apache can use different modules for communicating with Php in a FastCGI environment. For example mod_fcgid</p>

<p>To disable output buffering in a FastCGI environment, the following steps can be taken:</p>

<ul>

<li>output buffering can be disabled for Php by adding these lines to
php.ini:
<pre>
<b>zlib.output_compression = 0;
output_buffering = 0;</b></pre>
</li>

<li>The mod_fcgid buffering can be disabled by adding:<b>FcgidOutputBufferSize
0</b> to the virtual host configuration.</li>

<li>The buffering by Apache can be disabled by disabling the mod_deflate Apache
module</li></ul>
